# Munich Re – Life & Health Internship (Summary)

**Focus:** Life & Health data intake/validation to support reinsurance statements  
**Stack:** SQL Server, Excel/VBA · QC (quality checks) & reconciliations

## What I did
- Ingested client policy-level files; ran **QC** (row counts, ID uniqueness, date logic, missing/invalid values).
- Performed **reconciliations** (tie-outs) to summary/statement totals (premium, policies, claims).
- Flagged issues (e.g., mapping, modal-premium, schema mismatches) and drafted concise feedback.

## Why it matters
- Clean inputs → reliable experience analyses and accurate settlements.
- Reduced back-and-forth with clients; faster close on monthly/quarterly cycles.

## Illustrations (synthetic)
- Example QC checklist and recon table on **synthetic data** (no client info).
- (Coming soon) small SQL scripts for duplicate detection and tie-out queries.

## Repo structure (planned)

## Notes
All data/materials here are **synthetic/public**. No client or proprietary information.
